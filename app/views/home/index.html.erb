		<p>Volunteers are the backbone of our organization. Becuase of this, people 

from all walks of life come together to serve nutritious meals every week 

at one of our serving sites. 

Each year, over 100 volunteers work to complete over 2,000 volunteer 

hours throughout the year, which provides an annual value of over 

$45,000 to The Patachou Foundation.

Do your part and sign up today.
